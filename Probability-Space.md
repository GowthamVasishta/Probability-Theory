# 1. Probability Space
**Probability Spaces** are used to model random processes or experiments. It is defined as a triple:
$$(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$$

where  
- $$\Omega$$ is the **sample space** (all possible outcomes),  
- $$\mathcal{A}$$ is a **$$\sigma$$-field (sigma-algebra)**,  
- $$P$$ is the **probability measure**. 

## Understanding $$\sigma$$-field $$\mathcal{A}$$
$$ \sigma$$ algebra is collection of subsets of $$\Omega$$ that satifies below three properties.
