# 1. Probability Space
**Probability Spaces** are used to model random processes or experiments. It is defined as a triple:
$$(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$$

where  
- $$\Omega$$ is the **sample space** (all possible outcomes),  
- $$\mathcal{A}$$ is a **Ïƒ-field (sigma-algebra)**,  
- $$P$$ is the **probability measure**.
